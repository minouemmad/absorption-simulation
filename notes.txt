TODO

1. allow for updated drude parameters to update the graph in real time 

2. take in transmittance and/or reflectance data from user, then plot experimental absorption from that

2. add option to plot electric field distribution inside structure

3. simulate Biphoton Emitter structure; measured reflection; and simulated electric field
